LoanTap Creditworthiness Prediction for Personal Loans

This project focuses on building an underwriting layer for LoanTap, an online platform providing customized loan products. The objective is to determine whether a personal loan should be extended to an individual and recommend suitable repayment terms. This case study will address the underwriting process for personal loans only.

## Project Overview

The goal is to predict whether a credit line should be extended based on the provided data, using logistic regression for classification. We aim to identify real defaulters while minimizing false positives, ensuring we donâ€™t disburse loans to individuals likely to default.

## Dataset

The dataset `LoanTapData.csv` contains attributes related to loan applicants and their financial and credit history. The target variable is `loan_status`, which indicates the current status of the loan.

### Key Features:

- **loan_amnt**: Amount of loan applied for
- **term**: Duration of loan (36 or 60 months)
- **int_rate**: Interest rate on the loan
- **grade**: LoanTap assigned loan grade
- **emp_length**: Borrower's employment length in years
- **annual_inc**: Annual income of the borrower
- **dti**: Debt-to-income ratio
- **revol_bal**: Revolving credit balance
- **pub_rec**: Number of derogatory public records
- **mort_acc**: Number of mortgage accounts
- **application_type**: Individual or joint application
- And many more...

## Conceptual Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Checking dataset structure, missing values, and outliers.
   - ViZualization of relationships between features and the target variable (using count plots, box plots, heatmaps).
   - Checking correlations among independent variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creation of flag features: Convert categorical data to binary values for features like `pub_rec`, `mort_acc`, and `pub_rec_bankruptcies`.

3. **Missing Value & Outlier Treatment**:
   - Imputation of missing values and handling of outliers.

4. **Scaling**:
   - Normalization using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.

5. **Modeling**:
   - Logistic Regression for predicting loan approval.
   - Evaluation of results using:
     - Classification Report
     - ROC AUC Curve
     - Precision-Recall Curve

## Tradeoff Challenges

- **Minimizing False Positives**: Detecting real defaulters is crucial to avoid non-performing assets (NPAs), ensuring we only disburse loans to creditworthy individuals.
- **Precision vs Recall**: Optimizing the balance between precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (identifying true positives).

## Results

The model's performance will be evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**: Overall accuracy of the model.
- **ROC AUC**: The area under the ROC curve to evaluate classification performance.
- **Precision-Recall Tradeoff**: Assessing the balance between precision and recall to minimize financial risk.

## Actionable Insights & Recommendations

- **Risk Mitigation**: Focus on reducing false positives to avoid potential NPAs.
- **Loan Approval Optimization**: Tailoring loan approval criteria based on employment length, annual income, and revolving credit balance to ensure the right customers are granted loans.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `statsmodels`


## Conclusion

This project provides a structured approach to evaluating loan eligibility based on historical data, with a focus on minimizing financial risk through accurate predictions.
